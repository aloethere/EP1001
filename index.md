Aloethere!

I'm Nur 'Arifah from Diploma in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. This site is a documentation for my Elective Programme EP1001 - Further Digital Fabrication and Prototyping.

EP1001 is my second elective module after completing EP1000 in my Semester 3. Now in Semester 4, 2nd Year in Singapore Polytechnic, I am excited for showcase what I've learnt, and of course the Final Project! Stay tuned to see what I am going to make.

### About Me
<br><img src="https://github.com/aloethere/EP1001/blob/gh-pages/images/profile.jpg?raw=true" width="140"/>
<br>Grew up in the East of Singapore, I became interested in engineering after being captivated in tech videos on YouTube. Until now, YouTube is always my source of inspiration. I am always in wonderment when learning the latest technology available to us. I hope to be able to pick up engineering related skills and one day be able to contribute to my Muslim community and the society at large.

I am also passionate in learning and teaching the Quran. As of now, I have been teaching part-time as a Quranic teacher for 4 years. Another big dream of mine is to be a master in the Arabic language so that I could understand better in the studies of Quran and Hadith. Feel free to chat with me if you have the same passion as mine :D 

You can reach me on telegram.<br>
