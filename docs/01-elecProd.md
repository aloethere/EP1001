## PCB Fabrication

Printed Circuit Board or PCB are used to configure all the electronic components of a device together. The traces of a circuit board connects all of the electrical signals from one junction to another. In our last module, we used an Arduino to help us assemble our circuit. Now going up a level higher, we learnt how to build our own PCB. This means we have the flexibilty to design and customise our microcontroller board for better product integration.

This are generally the steps on how to create your own PCB:

**Step 1: CAD**<br>
To design our schematics, we are using [EAGLE](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/overview?plc=F360&term=1-YEAR&support=ADVANCED&quantity=1) as our software. EAGLE lets PCB designers make circuit boards by editing their schematics before printing it out. You can check out more of this topic on my [Electronics Design](https://aloethere.github.io/EP1001/docs/02-elecDesign/) page.
