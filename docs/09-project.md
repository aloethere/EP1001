# Final Project - Making a WALL-E Robot
---

The movie WALL-E produced by Pixar is a masterpiece that stucked with me till now. It's message is huge and not something to be ignored. If you havent seen the film yet, this ingenious movie would probably be your next favourite.

**Why make WALL-E?**

I have always wanted to make my own robot. And i guess that this is the perfect time to attempt to create it. If I am succesful, this will my first ever robot creation. WALL-E is darn cute, and not as complex as other animated robots. My intention is also to learn as much as I can through this project and enjoy the process. 



**The Plan**

When speaking to Mr. Yeo about my idea of creating a track based robot, he offered me to use a lego wheel and rubber track that fits together. I figured I have to design a triangular shape track and make do what is available. 

Meanwhile, I began researching more about WALL-E and other people's creation on it. I found out that there is a whole community called 'WALL-E builders Club' who build real life WALL-E. This discovery made me decide to modify the available blueprint an dmake it smaller and simpler.

For the brain of the robot, I have always wanted to learn more about the ESP32 microcontroller. And having a generic board of ESP32 would most probably helped me program the chip. But things dont always fall through as you planned. Huhu, I was so frustrated at this stage. But more on this at the Electronics page.
