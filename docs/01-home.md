Aloethere!

I'm Nur 'Arifah from Diploma in ELectrical and Electronic Engineering. This site is a documentation for my Elective Programme EP1001 - Further Digital Fabrication and Prototyping.

EP1001 is my second elective module after completing EP1000 in my Semester 3. Now in Semester 4, 2nd Year in Singapore Polytechnic, I am excited for showcase what I've learnt, and of course the Final Project! Stay tuned to see what I am going to make.
