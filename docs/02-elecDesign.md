## Designing a PCB using EAGLE

To create our own circuit board, we have to use a CAD tool to design the schematic and drawing its layout. Autodesk EAGLE is a software that helps us do just that.

I will be making an echo board using the [ATtiny85] chip. To get started, I will need to download and install the component library. The library I'm using is [fab.lr](https://gitlab.fabcloud.org/pub/libraries/electronics).
