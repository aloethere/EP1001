## Drive wheel

My first step was to design the tracks for WALL-E. Since WALL-E has a triangular shaped drive wheel, I attempted to position the 3 lego wheels together and fit the rubber treads for each side. From there, I estimated a fixed position where the 3 wheels would be and laser cut acrylic to hold the wheels on each side. This step took a few tries to get my rubber track drive treads fit well together without it being too tight or too loose.

While finalising my acrylic design, I also realised that it would be better if i trim the lego wheels to be narrower in width. This is so that the drive wheel tracks looks flushed. So i sawed them on each sides. I use a total of 6 wheel rims. I also attached some washers so there could be less friction when the wheels are rotating.

Later I messed up some of the given wheels. So I 3d printed my own. The 3D printed wheels are flushed as well and feature a hexagon hole for *this thing* to act as my axle.
