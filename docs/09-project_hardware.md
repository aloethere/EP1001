# The Hardware

## Tank treads

My first step was to design the tracks for WALL-E. Since WALL-E has a triangular shaped tracks, I attempted to position the 3 lego wheels together and fit the rubber treads for the left and right side. From there, I estimated a fixed position where the 3 wheels would be and laser cut acrylic to hold them together. The acrylic acts as a supporting frame for the positioned wheel rims. This step took a few tries to get my rubber track drive treads fit well together without it being too tight or too loose.

While finalising my acrylic design, I also realised that it would be better if i trim the lego wheels to be narrower in width. This is so that the drive wheel tracks looks flushed. So i sawed them on each sides. I use a total of 6 wheel rims. I also attached some washers so there could be less friction when the wheels are rotating.

I later messed up some of the given wheels. So I 3d printed my own. The 3D printed wheels are flushed as well and feature a hexagon hole for *this thing* to act as my axle. I printed 2 pieces and both are placed for the top position of the triangle, which will then connect straight to my continuous servo.

## Body

The rest of WALL-E's body stucture are based on [chillibasket's WALL-E replica on thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3703555). The dimension and designs are life-sized so I went to scale it down to 60% of it's original file. To do this, I downloaded the STEP files on thigiverse and modify accordingly on Fusion 360. Most of the modification is to delete unwanted features and re-size the screw holes.
